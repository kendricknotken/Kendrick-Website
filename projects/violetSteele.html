										<strong> Watched Aubrey Serr's GDC video on designing "Radically Non-Linear Levels‚Äù to see if this 
												structure could fit our game. The key points I took away from his talk were:
										</strong>
									</figcaption>

										<ul>
											<li> Creating circumstances that would allow for player choices. </li>
											<li> Giving players safe spaces to think and plan, but balancing it with other spaces that had pressure and stress. </li>
											<ul>
												<li> I planned to accomplish this by giving players multiple paths and ways to achieve their goals. For example, four keys are needed to open a door and each could be activated in any order, meaning players could choose which space they wanted to approach first and then where they wanted to move next. </li>
											</ul>

										<strong> I replayed games or watched gameplay that had mechanics that were similar to ours. Some key take aways:
										</strong> 
									</figcaption>
   							
										<ul>
											<li> A lot of games, mostly stealth, had a type of scan that would show points on interest. However, there were some noticable differences between some.</li>
											<li> For instance, <strong>Dying Light 2's scan (Survior Sense) </strong> would play a sonar wave that highlights all enemies while <strong> The Last of Us' scan (Listen Mode) </strong> would make everything black and white for as long as the player was in Listen Mode.</li>
											<li> <strong> Hogwarts Legacy's scan (Revelio) </strong> had a slight delay so that it matched the wand waving animation. </li>

				<!-- Decision Making Process -->
					<header class="style2">
						<h2> Decision-Making Process </h2>
					</header>

				<p> There were two primary reasons for creating this level (Sewer).
					 The first was to teach the player the basic mechanics of the game, and the second was to support the lore for Violet.
					 I planned to accomplish this by designing a level that gradually introduced mechanics and give the player opportunities to play with these new mechanics.
					<ul>
						<li> The core mechanics of Violet Steele are stealth navigation, noise manipulation, and interactions </li>
						<li>I wanted to build a level the reflects Violet‚Äôs wits, determination, and her previous knowledge of the city. 
							Violet has set out to infiltrate a building that‚Äôs located in a city under strict curfew. 
							Because of the curfew, Violet uses an old sewer system to sneak into a loading dock that leads into the city.</li>
					</ul>

				<p> The first section was designed to accomplish two things: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> The first is show the player how to sprint and crouch through obstacles</li>
						<li> The second is to set a short-term goal for the player to reach </li>
					</ul>

				<p> The short-term goal is made when a player looks down the tunnel and sees/hears a train passing by.
					 A point of interest that the player will want to move towards.</p>

					 However, that path is quickly closed off and the player must then be forced to go another way.</p>

					<h2> Basement </h2>
				</header>

				<p> In the Basement Level, I was building around the mechanics: <strong>  noise manipulation</strong> and <strong> stealth movement </strong>.</p>
				
				<p> To showcase these mechanics: 
					<ul>
						<li> Enemies had dedicated paths that encouraged players to sneak around </li>
						<li> Players were given hiding spots</li>
						<li> Space to use their ‚ÄúGear Throw‚Äù</li>

				<p> The first iteration of the basement level didn‚Äôt meet the criteria the way it was intended as:
					<ul>
						<li> It had low player visibility </li>
						<li> Too many choke points, player‚Äôs paths were very restrictive</li>
						<li> Player‚Äôs had difficulty finding a good use for their gear throw</li>
