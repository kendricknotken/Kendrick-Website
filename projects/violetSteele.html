						<!-- Description -->
						<p> <strong> Description: </strong> Violet Steele is a third-person action adventure stealth game set in the steampunk country of Novellia.
						Once a peaceful and flourishing country, Novellia is now under a hostile takeover by the Hex Alliance due to the abuse of robots fueled by
						the revolutionary invention of electricity. </p>

						<p>Play as Violet, the only citizen of Novellia who knows the truth: her father is the engineer who invented electricity, and he was killed
						by the Hex Alliance for his desire to share his discovery with the people to better their standard of living. Embark on a dangerous mission 
						to infiltrate the Hex Alliance headquarters with one goal in mind: retrieve the blueprints and fulfil her late father's final wish. But be
						warned, ruthless robots lurk around every corner, and the path ahead is fraught with peril.</p>

		<p> As the team's only Level Designer I was tasked with creating every level and using what gameplay mechanics we implemented to create space for the player to explore and play. </p>

		<p> I created <b> two levels </b> comprised of multiple sections. Level 1 included the <b>Sewer, Square, and Basement</b>.
			 Level 2 included the <b>Undercroft, Lobby, Bridge, and Top.</b>

		<p> My process for creating maps started with paper sketches, to 2D drawings, and then to gray box in the engine </p> 
			
			<!-- Sewer -->
			<header class="style1">
				<h2> Sewer </h2>
			</header>

			<p> The sewer section of Level 1 would serve as the introduction to the game's mechanics and also show the player how they entered the city despite the strict
				curfew. The sewer section would connect to a train station where the player would make their first encounter with enemies and be taught the basic mechanics</p>

		<p> As the Game Designer I helped design <b> all the gameplay mechanics </b> that were to be implemented into our game. </p>

		<p> The goal with these systems is to give the player a number of tools to stealth through each level the way they want to. </p>

		<p> With level design, comes aspects of environmental design and world building. So it was up to me to build a world that reflected the narrative of our game as well as the mood. </p>

		<p> In the "Square" I had one section of the space very crowded with pipes and evidence of life.
		This reflected the way of life for the people who lived here as they were still reliant on steam as well as each other to live.
		While the richer area had significantly less pipes, which reflected their move away from steam and towards electricity. </p>
