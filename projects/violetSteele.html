		<p> As the only teams Level Designer I was tasked with creating every level and using what gameplay mechanics we implemented to create space for the player to explore and play. </p>

		<p> I created <b> two levels </b> comprised of multiple sections. Level 1 included the <b>Square</b> and <b>Basement</b>. Level 2 included the <b>Undercroft, Lobby, Bridge, and Top.</b>

		<p> Before prototyping, I needed to understand the scope of the project, the narrative of our game, the gameplay mechanics, and our pillars. </p>

			<!-- Square -->
			<h2> Square </h2>
			<p> I placed the player in a large and open space with walls surrounding them. Their first objective is find the "Main" building that they will be trying to enter.
			However the player quickly learns that the straight path is blocked and they must find another way inside. </p>
				
			<p> The square would also serve as a place for the player to tryout some of the gameplay mechanics including movement and the scan. </p>

			<!-- Basement -->
			<center><img src="../images/Violet Steele, Basement.png" alt="Screenshot of the basement room in Level 1" width="500"/></center>
			<h2> Basement </h2>
			
			<p> I initially prototyped the basement to have large rows filled with pipes that went straight up and to the ceiling, to show that this area was used to send out energy to the surrounding areas. </p>

			<p>However this version of the basement had clear problems. The space was too tight and the player had a difficult time navigating where to go.
			I wanted to feel real, like a room could have been really used and built like this, but I also wanted it to be fun so I worked to find a balance. </p>

                <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="" alt="" /></a>
	
		<p> As the Game Designer I helped design <b> all the gameplay mechanics </b> that were to be implemented into our game. </p>

		<p> The goal with these systems is to give the player a number of tools to stealth through each level the way they want to. </p>		
	
		<!-- Environmental Design -->
		 <header class="style1">
                <h2 id="Environmental Design">Environmental Design</h2>
                </header>
                <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="" alt="" /></a>

		<p> With level design, comes aspects of environmental design and world building. So it was up to me to build a world that reflected the narrative of our game as well as the mood. </p>

		<p> In the "Square" I had one section of the space very crowded with pipes and evidence of life.
		This reflected the way of life for the people who lived here as they were still reliant on steam as well as each other to live.
		While the richer area had significantly less pipes, which reflected their move away from steam and towards electricity. </p>
